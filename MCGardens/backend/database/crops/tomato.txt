How to plant tomatoes:
1. Choose a sunny spot with well-draining soil.
2. Plant seedlings or seeds after the last frost date in your area.
3. Space plants 18-36 inches apart in rows or in a raised bed.
4. Water deeply after planting to help establish roots.
5. Mulch around plants to retain moisture and prevent weeds.
6. Stake or cage tomato plants for support as they grow.
7. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer once a month.

How to take care of tomatoes:
1. Water plants consistently, about 1-2 inches per week.
2. Prune suckers (new growth) to improve air circulation and fruit production.
3. Monitor for pests like tomato hornworms and treat as needed.
4. Check for signs of disease, such as blight, and remove affected leaves.
5. Harvest when tomatoes are firm and fully colored.
6. Rotate planting locations each year to prevent soil-borne diseases.
7. Provide additional support as fruit develops to prevent branches from breaking under the weight.
