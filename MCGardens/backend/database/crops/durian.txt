Durian is a tropical fruit known for its strong odor that some people find unpleasant. It has a spiky outer shell and custard-like flesh inside that is rich in nutrients. Durian trees can grow up to 50 meters tall and are native to Southeast Asia.

--how to plant
1. Choose a planting location with well-draining soil and full sun exposure.
2. Dig a hole twice as wide and deep as the durian plant's root ball.
3. Place the plant in the hole, backfill with soil, and water thoroughly.
4. Add a layer of mulch around the base of the plant to retain moisture and suppress weeds.

--how to take care
1. Water the durian tree regularly, ensuring that the soil is consistently moist but not waterlogged. Durians require regular watering, especially during dry periods.
2. Fertilize the tree every 3 months with a balanced fertilizer to promote healthy growth and fruit production.
3. Prune the tree to remove dead or diseased branches and shape the canopy for better air circulation.
4. Protect the tree from strong winds and storms that can damage the branches and fruit.
5. Harvest the durians when the fruit naturally falls from the tree, indicating ripeness. Be careful when handling the spiky fruit.
