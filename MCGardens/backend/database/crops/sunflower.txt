To plant sunflowers:

1. Choose a spot that receives full sun and has well-drained soil.
2. Plant the seeds directly into the ground after the last frost date in your area.
3. Sow the seeds about 1 inch deep and 6 inches apart.
4. Water the seeds well after planting.
5. Sunflowers typically grow best in soil that has been amended with compost.

To take care of sunflowers:

1. Water newly planted seeds lightly every day for the first week.
2. Once the plants are established, water them deeply once a week, providing about 1 inch of water.
3. Mulch around the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
4. Fertilize sunflowers with a balanced fertilizer once a month.
5. Stake taller varieties to support the stems as they grow.
6. Watch out for pests like aphids and caterpillars, and treat as needed.
7. Remove spent flowers to encourage more blooms and prevent self-seeding.
