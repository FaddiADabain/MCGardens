Biography: Apple trees are deciduous trees producing delicious fruits, known as apples. They are grown in temperate climates and require a period of cold to set fruit. Apples are a rich source of vitamins, antioxidants, and fiber.

How to Plant:
1. Choose a sunny location with well-draining soil for your apple tree.
2. Dig a hole twice as wide and just as deep as the tree's root ball.
3. Place the tree in the hole, making sure the graft union is above the soil level.
4. Backfill the hole with soil and tamp it down gently to remove air pockets.
5. Water the tree thoroughly after planting to settle the soil.

How to Take Care of Apple Trees:
1. Watering: Water newly planted apple trees deeply once or twice a week, especially during hot weather. Mature trees need about 1-2 inches of water per week.
2. Fertilizing: Fertilize young apple trees in the spring with a balanced fertilizer. Mature trees can be fertilized in the early spring before new growth starts.
3. Pruning: Prune apple trees during the dormant season to shape the tree, promote airflow, and remove dead or diseased branches.
4. Pest and Disease Control: Monitor for pests like apple maggots and diseases like apple scab. Use appropriate insecticides and fungicides as needed.
5. Harvesting: Harvest apples when they are ripe by twisting and pulling the fruit from the tree. Store apples in a cool, dark place to extend their shelf life.
