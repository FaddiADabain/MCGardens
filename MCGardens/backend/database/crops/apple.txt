Apple trees (Malus domestica) are deciduous trees that are cultivated worldwide for their delicious fruit. They are native to Central Asia and are grown in temperate climates. Apple trees can live for many years and produce fruit seasonally.

--how to plant
1. Choose a suitable location with full sun exposure and well-draining soil.
2. Dig a hole twice as wide as the root ball and plant the tree at the same depth it was in the nursery pot.
3. Water the tree thoroughly after planting and add a layer of mulch around the base to retain moisture.
4. Stake the tree if needed and loosely tie it to the stake for support.
5. Prune any damaged or crossing branches to promote healthy growth.

--how to take care of the crop
1. Water regularly, especially during dry periods, aiming for about 1-2 inches of water per week.
2. Fertilize the tree in early spring with a balanced fertilizer to support growth and fruit production.
3. Prune the tree annually during the dormant season to maintain its shape and encourage fruiting.
4. Protect the tree from common pests and diseases by monitoring regularly and taking appropriate action.
5. Harvest the apples when they are mature and store them in a cool, dark place to prolong their shelf life.
