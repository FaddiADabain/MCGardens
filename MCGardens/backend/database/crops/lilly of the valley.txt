**Biography:**
Lily of the valley (Convallaria majalis) is a fragrant and delicate perennial plant that is native to Europe. It is known for its bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in the spring and its sweet scent. Lily of the valley is often used in bridal bouquets and for its ornamental beauty in gardens. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic if ingested, so care should be taken when planting it in areas with children or pets.

**How to Plant Lily of the Valley:**
1. Choose a shaded or partially shaded location with well-drained soil.
2. Plant rhizomes (underground stems) in the fall or early spring, spacing them about 6 inches apart.
3. Cover the rhizomes with a thin layer of soil, leaving the tips exposed.
4. Water the newly planted rhizomes, then water sparingly until growth appears.

**How to Take Care of Lily of the Valley:**
1. Water regularly, keeping the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged.
2. Apply a balanced fertilizer in the spring to encourage growth.
3. Mulch around the plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
4. Remove spent flowers to encourage more blooms.
5. Divide overcrowded plants every 3-4 years in early spring to maintain vigor.
6. Watch for signs of pests or diseases, and treat as necessary.
